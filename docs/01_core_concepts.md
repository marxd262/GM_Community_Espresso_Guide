# 1. Repeatability and Workflow

I can't stress this point enough. Repeatability is one of the most important factors. The biggest advantage for GM is repeatability. It can replicate shots and do it again and again and again. All this with a stable pressure, flow and temperature. But for that to matter, you have to get some things right. It's important that your puck prep is repeatable. It doesn't matter what you do, you have to be able to repeat it. It starts with weighing the beans. GM cant do its job, if you don't use the same dose for your shots. The dose should have a good distribution in your portafilter and afterwards the tamp should be even with a consistent pressure. GM should also be repeatable set up.To have this repeatable I recommend to implement a workflow and stick to this workflow. Experiment with this and find out what works for you. It doesn't have to be complicated but it should be repeatable. 

## 1.1. My current workflow

1. Preheat my machine for 20 minutes. (The default standby time is too short for this. Increase if you want to preheat a bit longer)
2. Start my scale
3. Flush through the portafilter to make sure the grouphead and portafilter is preheated. I flush into the cup I'm gonna drink from to make sure its up to temp.
4. Weigh my beans.
5. Check that the grindsetting on my grinder is correct.
6. I grind directly into a cheap blindshaker from amazon.
7. While the grinder is working I put the cup with hot water on the cupwarmer and take the portafilter out.
8. I clean the portafilter with a towel to make sure it's dry and clean.
9. Put the portafilter with a funnel on my tampstation
10. Use the blower of my grinder to make sure all the grinds are in the Portafilter.
11. Use the blindshaker by shaking for 5-10 seconds
12. From about 5cm height use the blind shaker and let the grinds fall into the portafilter. I aim for a small mount in the middle.
13. Check distribution in the portafilter. Like I said, I aim for a small mount in the middle. If needed I distribute by knocking the portafilter.
14. Afterwards I knock the portafilter flat on the table to compress the beans a bit.
15. Use a self leveling spring tamper to tamp flat. ( If you don't have a calibrated tamper, it's better to tamp harder than to soft. It's not possible to tamp too hard, just too soft.)
16. Add my puckscreen and spring.
17. Empty my cup
18. Put the portafilter in the machine
19. Reduce pressure in machine by opening the steam valve for a second or two
20. Place the cup under the portafilter
21. Start the extraction
22. While extracting I clean around the prep area what needs cleaning
23. After extraction I instantly take the cup and put it on the cupwarmer.
24. I remove the portafilter, take the puckscreen and spring of
25. Knock the puck out and put the Portafilter back in.
26. Enjoy the espresso

That sounds like a lot of steps and extras, but in the end it's a workflow that I find easy to replicate without thinking too much. Maybe you noticed that some stamps that may be recommended seem to be missing. Like WDT, Distributor, flush after the shot. For me personally I noticed that they don't make a big difference.  
  
The Idea behind WDT is to remove clumps and distribute the grinds evenly. My grinder doesn't produce many clumps. Further I use a stepdown basket and don't have to grind as finely, this also reduces clumps. Also the distribution with a WDT isn’t needed in my workflow. The Blindshaker and hitting the portafilter lightly is enough to get a good distribution. I personally don't like the spinny distributors. They mostly just distribute on top and flatten it all out. The bottom stays untouched. They give the impression of a nice distribution but don't really deliver on this. And for a flush after the shot, After using a puckscreen I noticed that the water on top of the puck was clean and flushing after the shot just gave me clean water. So I just removed the step.

My checklist and workflow doesn't have to work for you. You should try to see what works for you and experiment if needed. Maybe some steps are too much for you or feel like a hassle? That's totally ok. Just find something that gives you repeatable results.

# 2. Water as a Solvent

In espresso, hot water functions as a solvent that pulls soluble flavors from the coffee grounds. Changing different variables, alters how much material the water extracts, shaping the final taste.

# 3. What does Gaggimate even do?

Gaggimate isn't just a magical creation that our saviour the mighty Wasp brought to us to awaken us. It's a fancy PID with extrastep and an automated recipe user. Those Recipes are called Profiles. They can massively change how the coffee tastes but in the end we as the user decide how they do it. These Profiles give us all one important thing: Repeatability.

# 4. Profiles

Espresso profiles are programmable sequences that tell GM what temperature, flow rate, and pressure to apply at each stage of extraction. A profile can contain several sections (such as pre‑infusion, pressure ramp, and steady‑state) each with its own targets. By selecting or customizing a profile, the user decides which aspects of the shot to emphasize, while the ultimate flavor still depends on the barista’s variables (grind size, dose, tamp, bean quality, etc.).

The most used profiles would be:  
Cremina Lever (medium - darker)

Damians Lever (light - medium)

Adaptive v2 (light - medium)

Automatic pro (light - dark)

All profiles have a sweet spot where they work the best. What they aim at and what to look out for is normally described in the Discord thread of the different profiles. Look at those threads first to get a starting point. Afterwards they need to be tweaked by hand.

# 5. The Taste of coffee

Espresso flavor can be boiled down to two primary taste axes: sour (linked to under‑extraction) and bitter (linked to over‑extraction). Balancing these extremes is the first step toward a good shot. Beyond taste, mouthfeel (the body and viscosity of the espresso)adds another dimension, ranging from thin and light to thick, juicy, or syrupy. Because each coffee bean (origin, roast, processing) expresses a unique combination of acidity, bitterness, and texture, the ideal profile varies from bean to bean. The only reliable way to discover your preferred espresso is to experiment with different variables, tasting the results and adjusting until the desired balance is achieved.

# 6. The Lifecircle of a shot

During extraction, the coffee bed releases compounds at different rates. The first seconds deliver the bulk of oils, volatile aromatics, and soluble solids, creating a thick mouthfeel, strong crema, and pronounced acidity. As the shot continues, fewer solids are drawn out, the liquid becomes more watery, and the balance shifts toward bitter, higher‑molecular‑weight compounds. An under‑extracted shot therefore tastes sour, while an over‑extracted shot tastes bitter.

A practical way to experience this progression is the onion‑shot test: during extraction switch the cups every 5–6 seconds. This results in multiple cups with an extraction gradient. Taste the cups in reverse order (last‑collected first) to perceive how the early, concentrated portion differs from the later, more diluted portion. This exercise highlights the evolution of flavor, body, and crema across the extraction. It also trains to taste the differences between sour and bitter.
